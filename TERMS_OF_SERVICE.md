## 1. Description of Service

Suspy is a bot application that can be added to servers with the appropriate permissions granted by server owners or administrators. Once enabled, Suspy will monitors messages containing links in real-time and uses AI (powered by [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)) to determine the safety of any included links. Unsafe or malicious links will be automatically removed, and a report will be sent to a configured moderation log channel.

Suspy is available for chat and social platform <!-- both --> "[Discord](https://discord.com)", provided by Discord Inc.
<!-- , and "[Telegram](https://telegram.org)" provided by Telegram FZ-LLC -->

## 3. AI Link Scanning

Suspy leverages [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) to analyze links from user **message content** and determine links safety. 

Server owners and administrators are responsible for informing members that all links shared within the server **may be monitored by Suspy**.

The detection system also may:

* Flag phishing, malware, scam, or suspicious links.
* Occasionally produce false positives or overlook on threats.

We encourage server owners and admins to review flagged messages and report any inaccuracies for improvement from the corresponding actions sent by the bot.
