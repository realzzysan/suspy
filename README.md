<h1 align="center">Suspy - Link moderation made easy</h1>

<a name="information"></a>
### ‚ùî What is Suspy?
Suspy is a bot for discord (and telegram soon), to help automatically scan and moderate suspicious link (like scam/phish/etc.) sent on your server, with the help of AI powered scan tool.

It can scan messages containing links sent in the server, evaluate how safe they are, and automatically moderate the message by deleting it and notifying an admin. It can also analyze new, unknown links using an AI-powered tool to detect threats in real time (using [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com)).

## üòÅ Cool, but i wanna try first!
Invite the bot to your server and run `/setup` after invite,
or add to your user apps (my apps) and use `/check`:
