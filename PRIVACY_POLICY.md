## 1. Information We Collect

Suspy only processes data required to perform its core functionality:

- **Message content containing links**: Temporarily scanned for URLs to assess their safety.
- **Links**: Checked against an AI system and known lists in database to determine if they're potentially harmful.
- **Server configuration data**: Includes settings like designated log channels.

Suspy **does not store full message histories or user identities**. Only flagged link metadata and minimal logging may be stored temporarily for reporting and debugging purposes.

- Notify moderators or log channels of flagged threats.
- Improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

## 3. AI Processing

Suspy uses [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) to assist with evaluating link safety. This may involve sending the link (and minimal surrounding text) to the AI model.

No user account data or private information is sent to Gemini.
